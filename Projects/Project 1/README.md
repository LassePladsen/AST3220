# Project 1: Quintessence. Scalar fields as an alternative to the cosmological constant
In this project we study and model the addition of a quintessence field to the model of the universe, as an alternative to the most popular $\Lambda$CDM-model. It consists of some analytical work and some numerical simulations. During the simulations we also compare with observational values to try to find the most probable parameters.

Each numerical problem has its own script for easy running.
