# Project 2: Big Bang Nucleosynthesis
In this project we do some analytical work on the process in the early universe known as the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis, where the different atoms were formed.
In the last half of the project, we focus on numerical simulations of the process, to try to figure out the different atoms and their abundancy. In addition, we compare with observed values and calculate the most probable model.

The simulation is located in the local package `bbn`, the projects problems also come with their own scripts for easy running.
